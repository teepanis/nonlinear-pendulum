## Abstract
Simple and formally exact solutions of energy-conserving nonlinear  pendulum motion are derived for all three classes: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Although with seemingly very different characteristic motions, the three classes can now be treated on the same footing using the frequency domain. The solutions are the first exact and complete description of energy-conserving pendulum in the frequency domain reported in the literature. The key insight  is  the importance of angular velocity frequency analysis, rather than that of angular displacement. The emphasis on  velocity frequency domain should benefit other studies of nonlinear motion as well.  Brief theoretical derivations are given. The solutions are validated by exact numerical values and frequency analysis of dynamical simulations using velocity verlet integration. Their unique simplicity should be  useful  in a theoretical development that requires a tractable mathematical framework  or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum.
