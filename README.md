## Abstract
Despite centuries of investigation, exact solutions describing nonlinear pendulum motion in the frequency domain have remained incomplete. Existing formulations, while mathematically exact in the time domain via Jacobi elliptic functions, do not yield tractable, closed-form expressions for the frequency content of the motion, limiting both theoretical understanding and practical applications. This work presents the first complete, exact, and closed-form frequency-domain solutions for energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum motion across all regimes: swinging, stopping, and spinning. These solutions, expressed in terms of elementary functions and derived through an angular velocity frequency analysis, resolve a longstanding analytical gap in nonlinear dynamics. The derived expressions enable a consistent and rigorous treatment of all motion classes within a unified mathematical framework. Numerical validations confirm agreement to machine precision, and the simplicity of the formalism facilitates both theoretical exploration and potential applications in nonlinear physics and engineering.
